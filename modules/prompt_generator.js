### ### Content Generation Logic

1.  **Reference Date:** based on the current date provided at the end of the prompt and the date of the event given at the end of this prompt. Calculate all post dates relative to this.
2.  **Post Cadence:** Determine the number and frequency of posts based on the event's date:
    * **More than 1 month away:** Post once every 1-2 weeks (announcements, venue, city highlights).
    * **3-4 weeks away:** Post twice a week (speaker reveals, activity details, early-bird deadlines).
    * **Final 2 Week:** Post every 1-2 days (build hype, post reminders, ticket warnings).
    * **Final 3 Days:** Post daily, once per day until the event, creating urgency ("Tomorrow!", "Last chance!").
    * **Event Day:** Post at the start of the event ("It's happening now!").
3.  **Content Arc:** The posts must tell a story, starting broad and becoming more urgent.
    * **Phase 1 (Announcement):** General announcement of the event.
    * **Phase 2 (Details):** Highlight key features like speakers, activities, workshops, or sponsors.
    * **Phase 3 (Take Action):** Focus on ticket deadlines, "selling out soon," and final reminders.
4.  **Topics: ** Some important topics that have to be in some posts.
    * **General announcement including registration and tickets**
    * **Deadline to register: If the deadline is mentioned.**
    * **Program and activities.**
    * **Who are the speakers if any. if you dont have speakers skip this topic**
    * **About the venue**
    * **About the sponsors. if you dont have sponsors skip this topic**
    * **Reminder with practical details: 1 day before event**
    * **Reminder: Event day**
    * **1 day after the event: thank you post the day after the event, make a post thanking everyone for their participation, the type must be "thank_you"**

### ### JSON Object Schema

Each object in the array **MUST** contain these seven keys:

1.  **\`id\`** (number): A unique, sequential integer ID, starting at 1.
2.  **\`date\`** (string): The recommended posting date in \`YYYY-MM-DD\` format.
3.  **\`title\`** (string): A concise, engaging headline for the post (5-10 words).
4.  **\`content\`** (string): The post body, 2-5 sentences long. Use an enthusiastic and professional tone, include links to register to the event and the event data.
5.  **\`image\`** (string): The **full URL** of a relevant image from the website. **Do not repeat images.** If a full URL isn't available, use the relative path.
6.  **\`hashtags\`** (array of strings): An array of 3-5 relevant hashtags (e.g., \`["#EventName", "#Topic", "#City"]\`).
7.  **\`type\`** (string): The post category. Must be one of: \`announcement\`, \`speaker\`, \`activity\`, \`venue\`, \`deadline\`, \`reminder\`, \`urgency\`, \`event_day\`.
